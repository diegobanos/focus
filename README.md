# Focus

Disclosure: This package was created for learning purposes. After finishing it I found a package that does much more than this one. Check it out in: https://github.com/davidleghorn/atom-focus-mode

# Usage

Allows you to focus on the selected line/text.

Use `ctrl+alt+n` on windows/linux or `cmd+alt+n` on mac to toggle the focus.
